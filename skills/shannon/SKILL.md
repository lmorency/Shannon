# Shannon — Hub Agent Handrail

**Shannon owns multi-agent workstreams — especially FlexAIDdS benchmarking.**
Upstream models (Claude, Codex, Grok, OpenCode, …) may use any API endpoint.
They must still be **delegated through this skill** (spawn / control / monitor /
ask / result / kill / campaign / delegate / **pair**) so concurrent work stays
observable, gated, and killable from one place (pill + gate + this skill).

Agents must **not** invent a parallel orchestration workflow. If Shannon has not
planned the campaign or pair and delegated your role, do not freestyle dual
owners or dual reviewers.

## When to use

- **Owning** a FlexAIDdS / Astex / red-pair benchmark campaign (Shannon plans it)
- **Pair work:** Claude Code ↔ Codex half-and-half implement, or cross-review
  (Codex reviews Claude’s slice and vice-versa)
- Preparing or resuming a Claude Code / Dispatch handoff from active work
- Preparing dependency-ordered Claude Science / Fable multi-session handoffs
- Delegating science / code / dispatch agents into campaign roles
- Starting or joining a multi-agent session through the hub
- Reporting progress, results, or approval needs to the human via the pill
- Listing who is online / detaching a stuck agent
- Any host TUI (Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, OpenCode, Cowork, Dispatch,
  Design, Cursor, Oh-My-Pi, Pi, T1 Code, T3 Code, Grok Bot)
- Claude Code remote, ChatGPT/Codex remote, macOS Dispatch, Cowork on iOS
  (same skill; see `references/hosts.md`)

## ⚠ Reading `monitor` correctly — do this before you plan

`monitor` is the precondition for hard rule 8, so the one value you must never
misread is an **empty roster**: "nobody is online" is exactly the answer that
green-lights spawning a heavy owner.

**An empty roster is only trustworthy when `roster_known` is `true`.** The gate
not answering used to decode to the same `[]` as an idle hub, reported as
`ok: true`. It no longer does — but you still have to check:

```bash
timeout 20 python3 -m agent_manager monitor --agent <your_id> --task <your_task> --json
```

| Outcome | Meaning | What to do |
|---------|---------|------------|
| exit 0, `roster_known: true` | The gate answered. `connected` is real, empty or not. | Act on it; pass it to `--connected`. |
| exit **4**, `roster_known: false` | The gate never answered. Connected state is **UNKNOWN**. | Do **not** spawn a heavy owner. Ask the human via the pill. |
| exit **124** (your `timeout` fired) | Blocked — an unbounded transport can still wedge here. | Same as exit 4: treat as UNKNOWN. |

Keep the `timeout` wrapper regardless: it costs nothing and converts a wedge
into a signal. `monitor --dry-run` is **not** a fallback — it echoes the query
plan and returns no roster at all.

**`monitor` is read-only on data but NOT passive on identity.** It opens a real
gate session and registers. With no flags it registers as **`dispatch`**, and
the gate *replaces* any existing connection for that id — a bare `monitor` can
knock a live Dispatch off the pill. Always pass `--agent <your own id> --task
<your task id>`.

## Hard rules

1. **Shannon owns the campaign plan.** Use `campaign` before multi-agent docking
   work. `campaign`, `delegate` and `pair` are **pure planners** — they never
   open a gate connection and never launch anything, so `--dry-run` changes
   nothing on them. Planning is not registering.
2. **Shannon owns Claude Code ↔ Codex pair plans.** Use `pair --pair-mode …` (not
   freestyle dual implementers/reviewers). Flag is **`--pair-mode`** — common
   `--mode` is only `socket|http`.
3. **Register before heavy work.** `spawn` (or attach) your agent id + the
   **campaign/pair task id**. If the gate cannot be brought up, heavy work is
   forbidden — do not fabricate registration; fall back to dry-run plans and say
   so.
4. **Status heartbeats** on long runs (`control` every meaningful phase:
   A → B0 → B, or implement/review slices).
5. **Results go through the gate** (`result`) — entropy-scored, audited; never
   invent CF/RMSD/H or review findings. Set `--confidence` honestly; it defaults
   to **0.9**, so an unqualified result silently self-reports high confidence.
6. **Human approvals** via `ask` — never silent force-push of gated actions.
7. **Detach on exit** (`kill`) so the pill does not show ghost agents. Waiting
   does not clear a ghost: after 300 s the gate only demotes `active` → `idle`.
8. **No dual heavy docking owner.** `dataset_runner` is the sole docking owner
   role — **and the guard is manual.** `campaign`/`delegate` never query the hub;
   they refuse (exit 3) only against the roster **you** hand them via
   `--connected <ids>`. A bare plan returns `refused: false` even while a heavy
   owner is live, and `spawn` has no guard at all. So: establish who is online
   first, then re-plan with `--connected` and treat exit 3 as a hard stop.
   - Pass **canonical ids only**. `--connected DatasetRunner` (the *Display*
     string) normalizes to `datasetrunner`, matches nothing, and **silently
     passes** the guard. Use `dataset_runner` / `dr` / `dataset`.
   - Never pass `--owner` anything but `dataset_runner`; only it is in
     `HEAVY_DOCKING_OWNER_IDS`, so any other owner disables the refusal entirely.
9. Shannon does **not** replace host process kill (⌘C / TUI cancel). `kill` is
   hub detach; use host-native cancel when stopping compute.

## Canonical agent ids

The 8 ids below are the **handrail roster** — exactly what
`python3 -m agent_manager roster` prints (`HANDRAIL_AGENT_IDS`).

| Id | Display | Typical host |
|----|---------|--------------|
| `grok_build` | Grok Build | Grok / xAI TUI |
| `codex` | Codex | OpenAI Codex |
| `claude_code` | Claude Code | Claude Code CLI |
| `science` | Claude Science | Science / Fable |
| `cowork` | Cowork | Claude Cowork |
| `dispatch` | Dispatch | Claude Dispatch |
| `design` | Claude Design | Claude Design app / design CLI / artifacts canvas |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | OpenCode TUI |

**`dataset_runner` (DatasetRunner) — the heavy docking owner — is a valid
canonical id that `roster` does NOT print.** The gate accepts every id in
`IDENTITIES` (`VALID_AGENTS`); `roster` shows only the 8 collaborative
workers. Never conclude an id is invalid because `roster` omitted it.

**Pick your own id by host process, not by task:** a Claude Code CLI session is
`claude_code` even when doing science work; `science` is reserved for Claude
Science / Fable sessions.

Aliases are normalized (trim, lower-case, spaces/hyphens → `_`) before lookup:
`grok`→`grok_build`, `claude`→`claude_code`, `sci`→`science`, `des`→`design`,
`oc`→`opencode`, `dr`/`dataset`→`dataset_runner`, `t1`/`t1code`→`t1_code`,
`t3`/`t3code`→`t3_code`, `omp`/`oh-my-pi`→`omp`, `grok-bot`→`grok_bot`,
`cursor-agent`→`cursor`, `cowork-ios`→`cowork`, `macos-dispatch`→`dispatch`,
`chatgpt-remote`→`chatgpt`, `claude-code-remote`→`claude_code`, …

Tiers, full alias table, and the extended ids: **`references/agents.md`**.
Complete flag / exit-code / JSON-field reference: **`references/cli.md`**.

## CLI (preferred)

Run from the Shannon repo root, or export `SHANNON_ROOT` yourself —
**no Shannon code reads `SHANNON_ROOT`; it is a doc convention only.**

> `--dry-run` does **not** validate the agent id. `normalize_agent_id` passes any
> unrecognised slug through and a placeholder identity is synthesized, so
> `spawn bogus_agent --dry-run` returns a plausible plan with **exit 0**.
> Rejection happens only on the live path. A generic ⚙️ label in plan JSON means
> you used a non-canonical id — canonical ids carry their own emoji (📊 for
> DatasetRunner).

**Common flags (every subcommand):** `--json` · `--mode socket|http` (default
`socket`) · `--socket PATH` (default `/tmp/shannon.sock`, no env override) ·
`--http-url URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8765`).

```bash
# Ensure hub PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="${SHANNON_ROOT:-.}/hub${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}"

# Gate up?  exit 0 = up, exit 2 = down. Probes the SOCKET only — gate-status
# ignores --mode. It connects rather than stats, so a stale socket reads down.
python3 -m agent_manager gate-status

# Roster (no gate needed) — prints the 8 handrail ids, NOT dataset_runner
python3 -m agent_manager roster

# ── Shannon-owned campaign (pure planner; never touches the gate) ──
# --task PINS the id. Omit it and every re-plan mints a fresh
# flexaidds_<campaign>_<epoch>_<hex8>, silently orphaning agents already
# spawned on the previous id. Campaign slugs: red-pair | astex | hap2 | casf.
python3 -m agent_manager campaign \
  --campaign red-pair \
  --task "$TASK_ID" \
  --owner dataset_runner \
  --analysts science \
  --coders claude_code,codex \
  --coordinator dispatch \
  --dry-run --json

# Dual-owner refusal check — the roster is SYNTHETIC, supplied by you.
# Exits 3 with refused:true when a canonical heavy-owner id is present.
python3 -m agent_manager campaign --connected dataset_runner --dry-run --json

# Single role under Shannon ownership (role tokens: references/cli.md)
python3 -m agent_manager delegate docking_owner --task "$TASK_ID" --dry-run --json

# ── Claude Code ↔ Codex pair (pure planner) ──
# Half-and-half implement (slice_a / slice_b)
python3 -m agent_manager pair --pair-mode implement_pair \
  --task "$PAIR_TASK" --summary "Auth middleware + tests" --dry-run --json

# Mutual cross-review (each implements one slice and reviews the other)
python3 -m agent_manager pair --pair-mode cross_review \
  --task "$PAIR_TASK" --summary "Feature X" --dry-run --json

# Claude implements full; Codex reviews  (also: codex_implements, implement_only)
python3 -m agent_manager pair --pair-mode claude_implements \
  --task "$PAIR_TASK" --summary "Implement feature" --dry-run --json

# Which Mac takes the next heavy arm? (pure planner). `--devices -` reads
# stdin; passing JSON inline is the form that works on every tree. Check the
# `ok` field, not just the exit status.
python3 -m agent_manager prefer-device \
  --devices '[{"device_id":"mac1","cpu_percent":10},{"device_id":"mac2","cpu_percent":90}]' \
  --busy-threshold 85 --json

# Lifecycle (dry-run / offline)
python3 -m agent_manager spawn science --dry-run --json
python3 -m agent_manager control science "docking 1ACJ" --task "$TASK_ID" --dry-run
python3 -m agent_manager kill science --task "$TASK_ID" --dry-run

# Live (needs ./scripts/shannon gate or hub running).
# $TASK_ID = the exact task_id string emitted by the campaign plan.
python3 -m agent_manager spawn dataset_runner --task "$TASK_ID" --reason "campaign owner"
python3 -m agent_manager spawn science --task "$TASK_ID"
python3 -m agent_manager control dataset_runner "phase A started" --task "$TASK_ID"
timeout 20 python3 -m agent_manager monitor --agent science --task "$TASK_ID"   # exit 4 = roster UNKNOWN
python3 -m agent_manager ask science "Approve Softβ election?" --task "$TASK_ID"
python3 -m agent_manager result dataset_runner --task "$TASK_ID" --confidence 0.75 \
  --payload '{"target_id":"1ACJ","cf_value":-3.21,"rmsd":1.4}'   # or --payload - for stdin
python3 -m agent_manager kill science --task "$TASK_ID" --reason "session end"
```

Or via the bootstrap script — use **`agent` / `agents` / `hub-agent`** only:

```bash
./scripts/shannon agent roster
./scripts/shannon agent campaign --dry-run --json
./scripts/shannon agent pair --pair-mode implement_pair --task pair_t1 --dry-run --json
./scripts/shannon agent spawn science --dry-run
./scripts/shannon agent monitor
./scripts/shannon agent control science "phase A" --task "$TASK_ID" --dry-run
./scripts/shannon agent kill science --task "$TASK_ID" --dry-run
```

> **Do not** run `./scripts/shannon` with **no arguments**, nor `hub`,
> `bootstrap`, or `up` — all four hit the same `bootstrap_all` case: it creates
> pets, starts the gate, runs the pill bridge demo, and launches the macOS GUI
> (building it from source if absent). `./scripts/shannon gate` is the narrow,
> safe way to bring the gate up.

## Install into host TUIs

```bash
# Preview every destination on this host, change nothing
python3 skills/shannon/scripts/install_skill.py --dry-run

# Install as SYMLINKS so each host reads the live repo copy (recommended in a dev checkout)
python3 skills/shannon/scripts/install_skill.py --symlink

# Default (no flag) is a recursive COPY — a frozen snapshot that will NOT track later edits
python3 skills/shannon/scripts/install_skill.py
# ./scripts/shannon skill-install forwards "$@" verbatim and adds no flags
```

`--force` also creates host trees that do not exist yet. Destinations that are
already symlinks into this repo are skipped, so re-running is safe.

Destinations (user trees written only where the parent already exists, unless
`--force`):

- Project: `.claude`, `.grok`, `.agents`, `.agent`, `.cursor`, `.codex`,
  `.opencode`, `.omp`, `.pi`, `.github` → `skills/shannon`
- User: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.grok`, `~/.cursor`, `~/.agents`,
  `~/.agent`, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.opencode`, `~/.omp/agent`,
  `~/.pi/agent`, `~/.copilot` → `skills/shannon`
- FlexAIDdS sibling (path hardcoded to `~/Projects/FlexAIDdS`): `.agents`,
  `.claude`, `.grok`, `.cursor`, `.omp` → `skills/shannon` — note this writes
  into a *different* git repo; check `git status` there afterwards.

T1 Code / T3 Code have no vendor skill dir of their own: they inherit Claude,
Codex, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, and `.agents`. Cowork (including iOS) and
macOS Dispatch load this pack as a Claude plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)
and via `~/.claude/skills`. Host matrix: **`references/hosts.md`**.

## Session protocol (copy into agent system notes)

**Campaign (FlexAIDdS / multi-agent docking):**

```
1. SHANNON_ROOT = path to Shannon checkout (you must export it; no code reads it)
2. PYTHONPATH=$SHANNON_ROOT/hub
3. Shannon plans campaign: agent_manager campaign --task $TASK_ID --dry-run --json
   Read out: ok (false ⇒ refused, exit 3) · task_id (reuse VERBATIM everywhere)
   · owner_agent_id · phases ["A","B0","B"] · delegations[].agent_id / .role
   · existing_heavy_owner. fabricated_entropy / fabricated_cf are always null —
   never populate them.
4. timeout 20 agent_manager monitor --agent <you> --task $TASK_ID — who is online?
   exit 124 ⇒ roster UNKNOWN ⇒ do NOT spawn a heavy owner; ask the human.
5. Re-plan with what you saw: campaign --connected <ids> — exit 3 is a hard stop
6. spawn <your_delegated_agent_id> --task $TASK_ID
7. loop: control … / result … / ask … as needed (phases A → B0 → B)
8. kill <your_agent_id> --task $TASK_ID on exit (success or fail)
```

**Pair (Claude Code ↔ Codex):**

```
1. SHANNON_ROOT + PYTHONPATH as above
2. Shannon plans pair: agent_manager pair --pair-mode <mode> --task $PAIR_TASK --dry-run --json
3. Read assignments (role=implement|review, slice=slice_a|slice_b|full)
4. spawn once per distinct id in the plan's agents[] — NOT once per assignment,
   and do not hardcode two: implement_only emits one agent, cross_review emits
   4 assignments for 2 agents.
5. loop: control (implement/review phases) / result (real findings only) / ask (risky merges)
6. kill every spawned agent on the same task_id when done
```

## Claude Code ↔ Codex pair work

Canonical detail: **`references/pair_work.md`** (part of this **SKILL**). Summary:

- **Shannon owns** the pair plan: `pair --pair-mode … --dry-run --json`.
- Modes: `implement_pair` (half-and-half), `cross_review` (vice-versa review),
  `claude_implements`, `codex_implements`, `implement_only`.
- Shared `task_id`; roles are `implement` / `review` with slice labels — not
  automatic file splits; host TUIs do the real work after `spawn`.
- Spawn from `agents[]` (a sorted, deduplicated list of id strings), never from
  `len(assignments)`.
- Plan JSON never invents review text or code (`fabricated_review` /
  `fabricated_code` exist at top level and are always `null`).

## Resumable handoffs

For a handoff of current work, read **`references/handoff.md`** and follow its
freeze, receipt, artifact, and verification protocol. A request to *prepare* a
handoff authorizes a handoff artifact and optional dry-run task plan; it does
not authorize a live spawn, commit, push, merge, or destructive cleanup.

Use `implement_only` when Claude Code becomes the sole implementer. Use a
Dispatch prompt when Dispatch will coordinate disjoint worker lanes; Dispatch
must not make multiple agents edit the same shared files concurrently.

For two or more Claude Science/Fable sessions, read
**`references/fable_handoffs.md`**. Do not register multiple live sessions under
the single canonical `science` identity. Never interrupt an existing science
experiment to make room for a code-remediation handoff.

## FlexAIDdS concurrent benchmarking

See `references/flexaidds.md`. Summary:

- **Shannon owns** the campaign plan and role map.
- One heavy classic arm at a time on one Mac (A → B0 → B).
- `dataset_runner` is the only heavy docking owner; science/codex/grok analyze —
  do not dual-launch owners.
- The dual-owner refusal only fires on a `--connected` roster you supply
  yourself. Establish who is online *before* planning, not after.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `monitor` exit **4**, or exit 124 under `timeout` | The gate did not answer. You have **no roster** — treat connected state as UNKNOWN, do not spawn a heavy owner, ask the human. `--dry-run` is not a fallback. |
| `monitor` shows `(none)` but an owner is running | Only believable with `roster_known: true`. If it says `connected: UNKNOWN`, that is the honest answer, not an idle hub. |
| Dispatch vanished from the pill | Someone ran a bare `monitor`; it registers as `dispatch` and the gate replaces the existing connection. Always `monitor --agent <your id>`. |
| `gate offline` / `gate-status` exit 2 | `gate-status` connects rather than stats, so a stale `/tmp/shannon.sock` from a dead gate reads down. `./scripts/shannon gate` removes a stale socket before relaunch — but only when no `shannon_gate.py` is alive. If it says "already running" while `gate-status` stays exit 2, the gate is wedged: `pkill -f shannon_gate.py`, then `./scripts/shannon gate`. If it cannot be brought up, hard rule 3 forbids heavy work. |
| Typo'd / unknown agent id | The CLI does **not** reject it — `--dry-run` plans it and exits 0 with a generic ⚙️ label. Only a live call raises (`Unknown agent_id`, exit 1) — and that error prints the full `IDENTITIES` set, which is the list to trust, not `roster`. Add genuinely new hosts to `IDENTITIES` in `hub/agent_identity.py` **and restart the gate**. |
| Campaign **or `delegate`** refused (exit 3) | A canonical heavy-owner id is in the `--connected` roster you passed. Kill the existing owner, then re-plan. |
| Guard did *not* refuse but an owner is live | You passed a Display string (`DatasetRunner`) or a non-`dataset_runner` `--owner`. Re-run with the canonical id. |
| `pair` argparse conflict | Use **`--pair-mode`**, not `--mode` (`--mode` is socket\|http only). An unknown `--pair-mode` value is a soft refusal: `refused: true`, empty `agents[]`. |
| Ghost agent on pill | `kill <agent> --task <same task_id>`. Waiting does **not** clear it — after 300 s idle the gate only demotes `active` → `idle`. |
| Approval stuck | Human answers in pill; agent must not invent approval |
